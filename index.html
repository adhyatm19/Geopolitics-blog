            The Indian government has added another crypto bill to the forthcoming winter session of parliament, titled
            "The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021." The measure proposes to
            prohibit all private cryptocurrencies, with a few exceptions.

            China
            <br>
            China and Russia have agreed to deepen strategic coordination in the defense sector triggering concern in
            Tokyo.

            Repeated military exercises by China and Russia can be regarded as “demonstrative action toward Japan,” said
            Japan's Defense Minister Kishi Nobuo.

            “The possibility cannot be ruled out that they will deepen their military coordination,” he added, according
            to a report by NHK News on Wednesday.

            The concern raised by Japan came as the defense ministers of China and Russia said “the solidarity between
            China and Russia is as strong as a mountain and friendship is unbreakable.”

            <br>
            The government bureau on Tuesday conceded authorization to India to utilize Pakistan’s territory course to
            deliver wheat help to Afghanistan where a large number of individuals face hunger as an unforgiving winter
            sets in.

            Islamabad will likewise send help, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in an assertion, including 50,000
            metric huge loads of wheat, coordinating with the level sent by India.

            “We have endorsed to give entry to this 50,000 tons of wheat that India needs to ship off Afghanistan,”
            Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry told a news meeting after the bureau met with Prime Minister Imran Khan
            in the seat.

        India-U.S. bilateral relations have developed into a "global strategic partnership", based on
        shared democratic values and increasing convergence of interests on bilateral, regional and
        global issues. The emphasis placed by the Government in India on development and good
        governance has created opportunity to reinvigorate bilateral ties and enhance cooperation under
        the motto --- “ChaleinSaathSaath: Forward Together We Go”, and "SanjhaPrayas, Sab ka Vikas"
        (Shared Effort, Progress for All) adopted during the first two summits of Prime Minister Modi
        and President Obama in September 2014 and January 2015 respectively. The summit level joint
        statement issued in June 2016 called the India-U.S. relationship an “Enduring Global Partners in
        the 21st Century”.
        Regular exchange of high-level political visits has provided sustained momentum to bilateral
        cooperation, while the wide-ranging and ever-expanding dialogue architecture has established a
        long-term framework for India-U.S. engagement. Today, the India-U.S. bilateral cooperation is
        broad-based and multi-sectoral, covering trade and investment, defence and security, education,
        science and technology, cyber security, high-technology, civil nuclear energy, space technology
        and applications, clean energy, environment, agriculture and health. Vibrant people-to-people
        interaction and support across the political spectrum in both countries nurture our bilateral
        relationship

        India–Pakistan relations (Hindi: भारत-पाकिस्तान सम्बन्ध; Urdu: بھارت پاکستان تعلقات‎) refer to the bilateral
        relations between India and Pakistan. The relations between the two countries have been complex and largely
        hostile due to a number of historical and political events. Relations between the two states have been defined
        by the violent partition of British India in 1947 which started the Kashmir conflict, and the numerous military
        conflicts fought between the two nations. Consequently, their relationship has been plagued by hostility and
        suspicion. Northern India and Pakistan somewhat overlap in certain demographics and shared lingua francas
        (mainly Punjabi, Sindhi, and Hindustani).

        China–India relations (Chinese: 中国－印度关系; Hindi: भारत-चीन सम्बन्ध), also called Sino-Indian relations or
        Indo–Chinese relations, refers to the bilateral relationship between China and India. China and India had
        historically peaceful relations for thousands of years of recorded history. But the tone of the relationship has
        varied in modern time, especially after the rule of Communist Party in China; the two nations have sought
        economic cooperation with each other, while frequent border disputes and economic nationalism in both countries
        are a major point of contention. The modern relationship began in 1950 when India was among the first countries
        to end formal ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan) and recognise the People's Republic of China as the
        legitimate government of Mainland China. China and India are two of the major regional powers in Asia, and are
        the two most populous countries and among the fastest growing major economies in the world. Growth in diplomatic
        and economic influence has increased the significance of their bilateral relationship.
